# GraphSearchApp

An app for my university.

# What you can do with it? 

Upload a txt file with a sample graph, choose an algorithm to optimize your search.

# What is the future of the project?

The project was just started. For now it has one algorithm. 
During the development, which this app is undergoing, it will become more modular and implement at least three different algorithms for searching the best way between nodes in a graph.
Changes to be made also include better looking UI, improving test coverage and using more suitable design patterns for the algorithms.
